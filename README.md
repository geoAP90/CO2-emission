# CO2-emission
EDA and Machine learning

Project Description
The amount of CO2 emission from the transport sector (including cars) accounts for about 20% of total CO2 emissions. Accordingly, from the viewpoint of preventing global warming, reducing that proportion is a key issue. In regard to CO2 emissions from cars, fuel economy standards are getting tougher all over the world, so improving the fuel economy of cars is strongly desired. This dataset captures the details of how CO2 emissions by a vehicle can vary with the different features. The dataset contains data over a period of 7 years. There are total 7385 rows and 12 columns. There are few abbreviations that has been used to describe the features.

Content
4WD/4X4 = Four-wheel drive
AWD = All-wheel drive
FFV = Flexible-fuel vehicle
SWB = Short wheelbase
LWB = Long wheelbase
EWB = Extended wheelbase
0.1.2 Transmission
A = Automatic
AM = Automated manual
AS = Automatic with select shift
AV = Continuously variable
M = Manual
3 - 10 = Number of gears
10.1.3 Fuel type
X = Regular gasoline
Z = Premium gasoline
D = Diesel
E = Ethanol (E85)
N = Natural gas
Fuel Consumption City and highway fuel consumption ratings are shown in litres per 100 kilometres (L/100 km) - the combined rating (55% city, 45% hwy) is shown in L/100 km and in miles per gallon (mpg) CO2 Emissions. The tailpipe emissions of carbon dioxide (in grams per kilometre) for combined city and highway driving

Solution Requirement:
Significantly reducing CO2 emissions from cars will not be easy, but the available data can be
used to extract the features, know the behavior of cars, and try to reduce the emissions. Machine
Learning techniques can be used in this regard.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Objective of EDA : 1. To check for missing data and other anamolies. 2. To gain maximum insight
into the data set and its underlying structure. 3. To check the distribution of the data. 4. Identify
the most influential variables.


Results: After doing careful EDA and ML modeling , I have come to a conclusion that the car brand, car model, vehicle_class, engine size, number of gears, fuel type, number of cylinders all have their effects on the co2 emission on the roads. After careful observation I have successfully circled out the the vehicles and their features which should be eliminated to get less co2 emission on the roads and also have shown with models how the co2 emission will be in the future if we continue these cars on the road.
